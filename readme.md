# Brew Tracker

I've been using a word document to track my recipes and brews and it's becoming overwhelming. I need the ability to track recipes and the brews I make with them.

## How to Run

```bash
docker-compose up
```

Docker Compose will create a MongoDB database instance and run the NodeJS server configured to point to the MongoDB database.
